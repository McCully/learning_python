### Learning Python From CodeSchool
1. Level One
    * Using a console to write Python.
    * Notice some similarities with functions between Javascript and Python.
    * So far I've touched on math equations, creating variables, importing modules such as math, and using the math module to use the function math.ceil(). Which is a lot like math.round().
